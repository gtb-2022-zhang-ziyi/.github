# Hi there 👋

## **You are reading Ziyi's Profile, so WATCH OUT🤪!**

Call me **Zoey**, call me **Ziyi**, call me **whatever** you want, just don't call me whatever.

I'm a wannabe programmer, a gamer, a movie-goer, a bathroom singer and a person who loves doing weird dance moves when no one's watching💃.

🙋‍♀️ This organization is mainly for homework that I did in GTB-2021 session. Before this, the most confident code I can write is `Hallo Welt`.

*Quick Fact: I learnt German for four years and I need to show it off to prove that I was not wasting my time learning German.*

👩‍💻 Hopefully I can become a real coder at the end of this session.
